Fall Prevention System with Airbag Protection System Using Arduino 


The Fall Prevention System with Airbag Protection is a safety mechanism designed to mitigate the impact of falls and reduce the risk of injury. 
This system utilizes a combination of sensors, including an accelerometer and a distance sensor, along with an Arduino microcontroller.
When a person experiences a fall, the accelerometer sensor detects the change in acceleration, indicating a potential fall event.
Concurrently, the distance sensor measures the distance from the ground.
If the distance measured by the sensor is less than a predefined threshold, indicating a fall from a significant height, the system triggers the deployment of an airbag for protection. 
This rapid response helps cushion the impact and reduce the risk of injury upon impact with the ground.
Conversely, if the distance measured by the sensor is within a safe range, indicating a minor fall or a non-fall event, the airbag remains inactive to prevent unnecessary deployment.
Key hardware components required for this system include an Arduino board for data processing and control, an accelerometer sensor for fall detection, a distance sensor for measuring the height of the fall, a relay for activating the airbag system, and a buzzer for providing auditory feedback.
By integrating these sensors and control mechanisms, the Fall Prevention System with Airbag Protection aims to enhance safety in environments where falls are a concern, such as healthcare facilities, construction sites, and elderly care facilities.
This system offers proactive protection against fall-related injuries, providing peace of mind to individuals and caregivers alike.
